# Adversarial Sign Detection: Shadow Attack and Defenses

This repository holds the code for our paper [PAPER-NAME] by Andrew Wang, Gopal Nookula, Wyatt Mayor and Ryan Smith.
The defenses are based off the adversarial attacks against road sign recognition models in [THIS PAPER] by Zhong et. al (2022). Our defenses achieve 84% robustness with a simple edge profile channel retrained on the paper's original CNN.
Please see our paper [HERE] for more details.

Each author's defense is in a folder in the format `{author_name}Net`, and instructions for running each defense can be found in `{author_name}Net/instructions.md`.
